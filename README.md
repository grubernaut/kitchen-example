Checkout [Blog Post](http://blog.grubernaut.com/kitchen-magic/) for all of the juicy details of the post!

Essentially, simply:
- Clone
- ```bundle install```
- ```kitchen test``` or ```kitchen conv```


Proof of concept, stitching together [test-kitchen](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen), [kitchen-puppet](https://github.com/neillturner/kitchen-puppet), and [kitchen-docker](https://github.com/portertech/kitchen-docker).
